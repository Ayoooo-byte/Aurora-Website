        The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, is a breathtaking natural
        phenomenon caused by the interaction of solar winds with Earth's
        magnetic field. These dazzling lights create vibrant displays of green,
        purple, and blue hues across the night sky, typically seen in
        high-latitude regions near the Arctic Circle. Many travelers seek out
        locations such as Norway, Canada, and Iceland to witness this magical
        display in person.
